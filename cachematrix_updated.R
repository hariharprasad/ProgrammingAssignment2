## Write a short comment describing this function  
## This functions adds four functions into a list.   
## The first function 'set()' defines a matrix and resets the old inverted matrix to 'null'  
## The second function 'get()' prints the data (matrix) that is being inverted.  
## The third function 'setinverse()' assigns the inverted data to an object 'm'  
## The fourth function 'getinverse()' prints out the inverted matrix (object 'm')  
## Its objective is to generate space for another function to save computation time by caching a computationally  
## intensive result that is meant to be repeated several times.

## Write a short comment describing this function

## This simpler function merely checks (using the 'getinverse()' function, whether there is already an inverse  
## matrix associated with the data that is benig imputed. If there already is, then that piece of information   
## is retrieved.  
## If that is not the case, then the inverse is calculated using the function 'solve()' and then is associated  
## with the function 'setinverse()'

        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
